Pentoo is a Live CD and Live USB designed for penetration testing and security assessment. Based on Gentoo Linux, Pentoo is provided both as 32 and 64 bit installable livecd. Pentoo is also available as an overlay for an existing Gentoo installation. It features packet injection patched wifi drivers, GPGPU cracking software, and lots of tools for penetration testing and security assessment. The Pentoo kernel includes grsecurity and PAX hardening and extra patches - with binaries compiled from a hardened toolchain with the latest nightly versions of some tools available. The latest release of the Pentoo Livecd is available [here](http://www.pentoo.ch/download/).

Pentoo comes in many flavors and utilizes catalyst as a build tool. [Catalyst](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Catalyst) is a release building tool, used by Gentoo Linux. With catalyst users are able to completely customize a Gentoo install by customizing the very tools that are used to install a system. Official Gentoo Linux release media is built using Catalyst.
